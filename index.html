       <strong><em>How my dogs are a part of my life and the order we got them.</em></strong>
        <br> 
        
<p style="color: red"> we had Hemmy, Sade, and (_______?) I do not remeber much about them so I am going to just list them.
 We got Bert frist he was blue and black I was 8 or 9 years old when they were still alive.
 we got the Catfish and the Neon tetras about 2-4 mounths latter.
 The first dog we got Addsonin Florda when I was 12.
 We got Shadow a year or two afterwords becuase Addson thought we were playing everytime we went up stiars.
 When we got Dash it was two years ago from around Septber to Decmeber and he is able to use the fluent pet system. </p>
